+Problems with op_br: when adding op_br to control ROM file (even just case) crashes the simulation
+Checked if op_br declared in lc3b_types: done, still not working. 
+when simulating, load_pc has an 'x' value in control word. 
+May not exist anymore or may not have default value. 
+Changed load_pc default's value to 0, which fixed the first simulation problem. 
+Breaks when fetch instruction for NOP or branch. 
+PC goes to xFFCA before going back to 0. P
+roblem with branch enable of Fetch stage.
+Try moving nzp (CCcomp) from EX stage to ID stage to give time to process and get right branch ena
+right now (before change) comparing wrong values.
+Part of problem fixed, but PC goes down: branches back to a NOP.
+sr2_out goes to 6, dk why. NVM coming from PCOffset (normal).
+Looking at AdderMux and tracing back, coming from adder, taking address from 3 stages before.
+Try add extra NOP to testcode to create some sort of delay since the right address is passed in ev
+Problem may come from the way PC is loaded: in pcmux, if branch chooses mux entry b, although shou
+Will move CCcomp to write back with genCC and create CC reg with load_CC in control word.
+Need to relocate br_taken generation to write back stage.
+reuse branch enable as pcmux_sel in fetch stage.
+TEst method: BRp -- works
+BRnzp to prove all comparisons work -- works
